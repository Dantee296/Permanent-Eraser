    1. Wipe free space NAS mode wiping performs delay before temporary 
	file deleting. Instead of prev version waits before passes.
	
    2. Wipe files in NAS mode. 
	a.It creates file list to be wiped as prev version.
	b.For every pass it completely wipes all files in list as prev version.
	c.It performs assigned delay before next pass as prev version. 
	    But it does not delete and does never truncate files between 
	    wiping passes. It allows to overwrite the original space busied
	    by the file.
	d.Files are deleted afer the NAS delay.    <li>New wiping standards added: U.S. DoE, German BCI/VSITR, Bruce Schneier's.</li>
